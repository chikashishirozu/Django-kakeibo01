# Django-kakeibo01
I built a home budgeting app with Django.

# Create a directory in the budget app
cd budget
mkdir -p management/commands

# Create the necessary __init__.py file (IMPORTANT!)
touch management/__init__.py
touch management/commands/__init__.py

# Create setup_categories.py
# (Use the same code from the previous time)
Industry Tip: Why do we need __init__.py?
To make it recognized as a Python "package". Django scans the management/commands/ directory and registers the .py files in it as commands. Without __init__.py, it will be treated as "just a directory" and will not be recognized.

# Run in the project root (where manage.py is located)
python manage.py setup_categories

Industry common: Custom command usage
In actual development sites, custom commands are used for the following purposes:

1. Database initialization
bash
python manage.py setup_initial_data
python manage.py import_legacy_data
2. Periodic tasks (via cron)
bash
# Run daily
python manage.py daily_report
python manage.py cleanup_old_data
3. Maintenance tasks
bash
python manage.py fix_data_inconsistency
python manage.py recalculate_totals
Runtime troubleshooting
Common error 1: No module named 'budget.models'
Cause: Missing __init__.py file Solution: Place an empty __init__.py in each directory

Common error 2: Unknown command: 'setup_categories'
Cause: Django doesn't recognize the command Solution:

Check file placement
Check if 'budget' is registered in INSTALLED_APPS
Common error 3: apps aren't loaded yet
Cause: Django environment not initialized properly Solution: Run via python manage.py

Pro Tips ðŸ’¡
Industry common sense: Always implement the --help option for custom commands. This will prevent your future self or colleagues from wondering, "What does this command do?"

Also, in a production environment, it is best practice to add the --dry-run option (which does not actually run the command, but only displays what it does). Countless developers have cried over deleting large amounts of data...ðŸ˜…
